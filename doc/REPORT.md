# Reflective Report

## The use of Git

I have previous experience with Github in the form of browsing other software packages to locate example uses and correct syntax (README.md). Using Git to create my own repository was novel to me and a tool I will continue to implement for collaborative projects and to "user" test any software I am involved in developing. Forking projects to create different applications and branching to keep track of development will be useful also. The structure of a Git repository will also assist in segmenting my future projects into functional parts that can be adapted as required.

## Version control

Through project forks and updates, version control will help progress any future software I am involved in developing. Keeping track of changes and ensuring collaborators are working on the most recent software version will accelerate the development of applications, improve their quality, and promote code creativity.

## Sandbox/Venv

Prior to this module, I had been installing all python packages (modules) on my machine locally. The concept of creating a venv for each new project will allow me to keep track of the required dependencies for each project to prevent software version clashes and improve software usability. I had previously used pip to install required dependencies but the concept of storing them all in a requirements.txt file that can be automatically downloaded for each project was novel, which I will continue to make use of. 

## Modules

I have used modules throughout my degree and have often referred to their manual pages for example uses and available tools. The modules matplotlib, numpy and argparse were relatively new to me and it was useful to understand how they can be used effectively. I will use matplotlib and numpy extensively throughout the rest of my course for data visualisation and mathematical functions respectively. I have recently developed an interest in deep learning and neural networks in data analysis, which can use both modules. Argparse will be useful for the development of CLI software which I will be involved in during the remainder of the course and further into the future.
